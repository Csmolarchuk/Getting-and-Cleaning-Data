## Project Description
This project contains summary data of each individual for each activity from the UCI HAR Dataset.The cleaned data set contains 40 observations from 30 subjects for different activities and measurements from 68 variables. 

##Study design and data processing
This project combined datasets from the UCI HAR Dataset which contained data for 30 subjects doing different activities. The variables in this dataset contain the mean measurement of each subject for each activity for each variable that initially measured a mean or standard deviation. 

###Collection of the raw data
The data was collected using an embedded gyroscope in a Samsung Galaxy SII that was worn on each subject's waist. The gyroscope collected measurements for 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz.

##Creating the tidy datafile
The dataset was downloaded from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip. The data was opened and cleaned using RStudio version 0.99.467 to create dataset.txt

###Guide to create the tidy data file
1. Download the data
2. Open the data in R Studio
3. Apply variable labels and merge the datasets
4. Select variables containing measurements of a mean or standard deviation
5. Create a new variable containing the mean of each variable by activity type and subject ID

###Cleaning of the data
Short, high-level description of what the cleaning script does. [link to the readme document that describes the code in greater detail]

##Files included in the dataset
dataset.txt - contains the data for the dataset
Codebook.md - describes all of the variables
run_analysis.R - containes the R script used to generated the dataset from the original data
ReadMe.md - provides an overview of the dataset

##Description of the variables in the dataset.txt file
General description of the file including:
 - Dimensions of the dataset
 - Summary of the data
 - Variables present in the dataset

(you can easily use Rcode for this, just load the dataset and provide the information directly form the tidy data file)

###Variable 1 (repeat this section for all variables in the dataset)
Short description of what the variable describes.

Some information on the variable including:
 - Class of the variable
 - Unique values/levels of the variable
 - Unit of measurement (if no unit of measurement list this as well)
 - In case names follow some schema, describe how entries were constructed (for example time-body-gyroscope-z has 4 levels of descriptors. Describe these 4 levels). 

(you can easily use Rcode for this, just load the dataset and provide the information directly form the tidy data file)
